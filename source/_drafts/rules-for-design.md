- Err on the side of simplicity.
- Reduce the number of variables.
- Add details only when they make things more clear.
- Give attention to things that deserve attention. Other things are secondary.
- Leave one thing for people to remember, but no more. One quirk.
- When in doubt, go with black.
- Never use pure black. Use dark gray instead.
- *Movie test*. Ask yourself if it's fit to be shown in a movie. If not, it's too complex.
- Rational
- Make it get better with use and age.

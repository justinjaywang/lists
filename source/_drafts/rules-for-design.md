- Err on the side of simplicity.
- Limit the number of variables, such as lines, colors, fonts.
- Add details only to make things more clear.
- Give attention to things that deserve attention. Other things are secondary.
- Leave one thing for people to remember, but no more.
- When in doubt, go with black. Or white.
- But never go with pure black. Use dark gray instead.
- *Movie test*. Ask yourself if it's fit to be shown in a movie. If not, it's too complex.

- Err on the side of simplicity.
- Reduce the number of variables wherever possible.
- Add details only when they make things more clear.
- Give attention to the things that deserve attention.
- Leave one quirk, at most, for people to remember.
- When in doubt, go with white or black (but rarely pure white or pure black).
- *Movie test*. Can you picture it portrayed in a film? If not, it's too complex.
- Make it sustainable.
- Make it timeless.
